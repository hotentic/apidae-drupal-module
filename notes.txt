Drupal 8 = Guzzle 6+
Sitra PHP updated but broken in latest master
Guzzle 5 -> 6 involves important changes in the requests preprocessing

Fixes so far :
Removed some operations that would cause WSOD
Replaced postField by formParam in Search operations
Commented stuff in SitraException since signature should have changed
Added apikey and projectId directly in searchObjects call of ApidaeController
